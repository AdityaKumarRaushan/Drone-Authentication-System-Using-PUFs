# Drone Authentication System using Merkle Trees & PUF

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a **secure authentication framework** for drones, ground stations, and users. It combines **Merkle Hash Trees**, **Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs)**, and **lightweight cryptographic operations** (SHA-256, ECC, AES-GCM) to provide **mutual authentication** and **secure communication** across devices.

- **User**: Laptop client for registration, authentication, and secure messaging.  
- **Drone**: Raspberry Pi-based client with PUF response generation and Merkle proof handling.  
- **Ground Station (GCS)**: Laptop server managing registration, authentication, and Merkle forest of drones.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **User Registration & Authentication** with Ground Station  
- **Drone Registration & Authentication** using Merkle Proofs  
- **Mutual Droneâ€“Drone Authentication** without Ground Station involvement  
- **PUF Integration** for unique hardware-bound authentication  
- **Performance Monitoring** of cryptographic operations across devices  

## ðŸ”‘ Cryptographic Operations
- **SHA-256**: Hashing IDs, nonces, and token derivation  
- **ECC**: Publicâ€“private key generation  
- **AES-GCM**: Secure message encryption/decryption  
- **PUF**: Hardware-bound identity generation for drones  
- **Random Nonces & Timestamps**: Prevent replay attacks  

## Way of Implementation

This project was implemented and tested in a real-world simulation environment. Two laptops were used to represent user devices, two Raspberry Pi boards were configured to simulate drones, and one laptop acted as the Ground Station (GS). The communication between these entities was carried out over a local Wi-Fi network, where the GS operated on `192.168.137.1:8000` and each drone was accessible on its respective Raspberry Pi IP at port `8001`. The implementation leverages **ECC** for key generation and authentication, and **AES-GCM** for secure message encryption and decryption, with configurations made flexible through host and port parameters. This setup closely mirrors the interaction model of real-world UAV networks, ensuring practical applicability and reproducibility.
